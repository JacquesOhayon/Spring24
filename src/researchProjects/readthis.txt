This folder was created to provide organization and structure amongst primary pages and secondary pages.
The secondary pages that would be placed here are pages that users will be directed to once they clik on the 
corresponding thumbnail in the research page. Currently, the thumbnails direct users to pages of specific 
information on the old website.

Please add pages regarding specific research and health information in this folder.
